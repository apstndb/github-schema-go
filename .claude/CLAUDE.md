# Project-specific instructions for github-schema-go

## Documentation style
NEVER use decorative elements like emojis (ðŸš€, ðŸ“¦, ðŸ”§, etc.) in documentation files including README.md, doc comments, or any other markdown files.
Keep documentation professional and plain text only.

## Git practices
- Use `git add <file> ...` instead of `git add .`.
- Use `git status` before commit.

## Markdown
When a string starting with @ appears in Markdown, such as in pull requests or issues, always escape it unless it is intended as a mention.
